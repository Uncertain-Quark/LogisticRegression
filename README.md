# LogisticRegression
A numpy implementation of vanilla Logistic Regression using gradient descent. This is a vectorized implementation with minial usage of loops.

An example for testing the code is using MNIST.

## TODO
- Multiclass Logistic Regression
- Extend to hidden layers

## Requirements
- *Numpy*
- *Keras* (For MNIST, not required for running the classifier)
